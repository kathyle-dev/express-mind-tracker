# Express Mind Tracker

#### Project Scope: Create a CRUD API using Express. I chose to make a "mind tracker" where the user can write down their thoughts under 5 categories: Energized, Stressed, Annoyed, Lesson, and Motivation. They can then click the category buttons to display their thoughts from only that specific category.

# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API, JSON, Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB

# Optimizations:
#### Use of the "category" params during the GET method to help filter the database "response" while rendering the profile.ejs file.

# Lesson Learned:
#### I learned that when using another 'ejs' file, I needed to add a "/" in front of any linked files.

## Installation
